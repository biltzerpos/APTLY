# The scripts in this folder were created by Ricardo Reimao
# They are used to perform a variety of audio pre-processing in a dataset.
# All the scripts run on a folder basis, meaning that you pass as input one folder containing the audio and it returns a folder containing the processed audio
# As the scripts vary a lot, please check the documentation in each script for more details on how to run them.

# Most of the scripts are based on the SoX tool (http://sox.sourceforge.net), make sure you have it installed before trying to run the scripts
