# The scripts in this folder were created by Ricardo Reimao
# They are used to extract image representations ("spectrograms") from audio files in a folder
# This is useful for DEEP LEARNING analysis, using IMAGE CLASSIFICATORS (VGG16/VGG19/MobileNet/etc..)
# Example: Extract the STFT spectrogram for each audio file in a folder.
# The script requirements (and more detailed documentation) can be found in each script

# All the training scripts have two arguments, the first one is the INPUT FOLDER (containing the original audio WAV files)
# The second input is the OUTPUT FOLDER (which will contain the "spectrograms")
